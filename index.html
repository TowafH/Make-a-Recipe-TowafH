    <ol>
      <li>Boil potato: Peel and then cut potatoes in half. Place in a
        pot of cold water, bring to boil then cook until very soft, ~10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mash roughly: Remove the potatoes onto a plate and roughly mash with a fork,
        leaving some large chunks</li>
      <li>Cook spice seeds: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds & coriander
        seeds. Stir the spices for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the ginger, chilli, and peas: Continue to stir a further minute or so until the chilli is soft. </li>
      <li>Add remaining spices: Add the garam masala, amchur, asafoetida, cumin powder, turmeric and salt. Cook a
        further 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add potato and gently stir to coat in spices for about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Cool: Remove from the stove, stir in chopped coriander leaves. Spread potato mixture out on a plate and let it
        cool completely before using.</li>

      <li>Mix dry ingredients: Place the flour, salt and ajwain seeds into a bowl and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Rub ghee into flour: Add the ghee or oil and mix with your fingertips until the dough resembles breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>Form a ball: Add the water and mix with the flour until you form a ball of dough. It should be pliable and
        soft, but not so sticky it sticks to your hands.</li>
      <li>Rest 30 minutes: Cover the dough in the bowl with glad wrap and leave to rest for 30 minutes.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Cut into 6: Cut the dough into 6 equal portions, then roll each into a ball. Keep the balls on a plate covered
        with cling wrap so they don't dry out.</li>
      <li>Place between paper: Place one ball on a sheet of parchment/baking paper. Press down to flatten, then cover
        with another sheet of paper. Do not flour the work surface – it will dry the pastry out.</li>
      <li>Roll out: Roll the dough into a disc about 2mm / 1/10" thick.</li>
      <li>Cut in half: Cut through the centre to create two semicircles (2 samosas per disc).</li>
      <li>Make cone: Brush the straight side with water, then fold straight edge to join itself and form a cone. Overlap
        the edges by about 1 cm / 2/5" then press edges to seal.</li>
      <li>Fill with potato: Make an "O" with your forefinger and thumb, then hold the cone in the "O". Fill with about 2
        tbsp of Potato Mixture, lightly pressing in.</li>

      <li>Seal: Brush the open pastry edge with water, then press together so your Samosa is fully sealed. Place sealed
        edge down on work surface and press down to fold. Trim off excess pastry, fold in corners. Pinch the top corner
        to make it pointy.</li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining Samosas. You should make 12 in total.</li>
